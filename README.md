## What is Auto-Editor?
[Auto-Editor](https://auto-editor.com/) is a command line tool to automate some simple video editiing tasks, such as cutting out silence and dead-space. Great for students who want to watch lecture videos in less time, or content creators editing a long interview.

## Why do we need Golem?
you can absolutely run auto-editor on your own computer, but the video encoding and other processing that it performs can be very intensive, so distributing it over many computers can help speed it up greatly. 



## What is the Golem Network?
[Golem Network](golem.network) is a decentralized distributed super-computing platform. Read more about it at their website.
